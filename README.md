Hi! I‚Äôm Matteo, a freshly graduated physics master‚Äôs student from the University of Milan, passionate about general relativity, cosmology, and everything that bends spacetime.
In 2025, I completed my master‚Äôs thesis on synthetic maps of the perturbed gravitational-wave luminosity distance and their cross-correlations with large-scale structure probes ‚Äî bridging theory, simulations, and data analysis.

The animation on the right shows one of the most fascinating effects I‚Äôve studied: gravitational lensing, where massive objects warp spacetime and deflect light like a cosmic magnifying glass.


Beyond my academic work, I have a strong passion for programming ‚Äî from software development and automation to data analysis and creative coding ‚Äî and I enjoy using technology to solve problems and bring ideas to life.

Outside of physics and coding, I love reading, surfing, playing the piano, and listening to classical music.
